# pixel-parliament
Visualizes the Members of UK Parliament as coloured pixels.

Pixel Parliament was created using the UK Parliament's dataset API: [data.parliament.uk](http://www.data.parliament.uk/)

Each current Member of Parliament is represented by a "pixel", where the colour of the pixel corresponds to their political party.
The members can be sorted randomly, by name or by party.

**Note:** Some of the data displayed is not accurate and not all Twitter/webpage links are working at the time of writing this.

### Future ideas ðŸ’¡

- Sort members based on a specific parliamentary vote
- Display the members' pixels based on the geographic location of their constituency
